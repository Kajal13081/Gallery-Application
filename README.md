# Guidelines for Mentors

You must follow the guidelines!

```1. Prepare a clear and beginner-friendly explanation for the project you are mentoring and add a properly documented README file to your project repo. The details of the project objective and Tech-stack should be clearly mentioned.```

```2. On the creation of the respective project channels on discord, all the necessary documentation and learning resources for contribution must be shared. Please ensure that the important links and messages are to be pinned to the channel.```

```3. Add the JWOC tag to all your issues on GitHub. Please use labels with a proper color scheme to differentiate the issues based on their difficulty level and tech-stack/problem tag.```

```4. Issues need to be assigned on a First-Come-First-Serve basis and are applicable only when they are opted through GitHub.```

```5. Each issue needs to be completed within a specific time limit according to its difficulty level (Easy: 1 day, Medium: 2-3 days and Hard: 4 days). If a mentee is unable to solve the allotted issue within the given period, the issue needs to be passed to other contenders on the discretion of the mentor.```

```6. A mark sheet needs to be maintained by all mentors to tabulate the scores of each participant and needs to be submitted at the end of both Phase 1 and Phase 2.```

```7. The projects with a comparatively lesser contribution or popularity after Phase 1 are to be given a shoutout at the beginning of Phase 2. Any change in contribution rules will be notified by the organizers in due time.```

```8. Project Mentors who will be consistently inactive during the 1st Phase will be barred from moving into the 2nd Phase.```

```9. Any doubts regarding the event or the contribution life-cycle need to be informed to the organizers at the earliest. Any form of misconduct by the Mentors will not be tolerated. Mentors are also requested to report any incident when the Mentees resort to unethical behaviour or are seen breaking the code of conduct.```

# Guildelines for Mentees

You must follow the guidelines!

```1. The Community Bonding period is given for all to interact with the mentors to understand the projects and issues. Mentees are not allowed to opt for any issues during this period. Any necessary help regarding the tech stack or tutorials are to be provided by the respective Project Mentors.```

```2. Issues will be allotted on a First-Come-First-Serve basis and are applicable only when they are opted through GitHub. You can start working on an issue only after it has been assigned to you by the Mentor.```

```3. Mentees are allowed to work only for a maximum of 2 issues at a time across all projects. No more issues will be allotted before they are completed, i.e the Pull Request for the respective issue is successfully merged.```

```4. Each issue needs to be completed within a specific time limit according to its difficulty level (Easy: 1 day, Medium: 2-3 days and Hard: 4 days). If a mentee is unable to solve the allotted issue within the given period, the issue will be passed to other contenders on the discretion of the Mentor.```

```5. We encourage you to ask your doubts and seek community help in the respective project channels. Our motive is to promote a healthy competitive and learning atmosphere with the help of our event.```

```6. Any form of misconduct by the Mentees will not be tolerated. Any mentee who is seen resorting to unethical behaviour or breaking the code of conduct will be disqualified from the event on the discretion of the organizers.```

```7. Respect and patience are the base requirements for you all to gain the best outcome from JGEC Winter of Code.```
